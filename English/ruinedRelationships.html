                                                 Does it have positive or

                                                 usually communicate their

                                                 away Thanks to the advancement
                                                 of technology, today’s people
                                                 can use modern ways to
                                                 communicate such as telephone,
                                                 email, social networks, and so
                                                 forth. This has totally changed
                                                 the way people contact with
                                                 each other. The modern
                                                 technology has deeply affected
                                                 the relationship between people
                                                 in some aspects. The most
                                                 obvious changes are that people
                                                 can work, study and carry out
                                                 other tasks without
                                                 face-to-face contact in some
                                                 cases. For instance, people can
                                                 study through the Internet.</p>
                                                                          <p
                                                 style="text-align: justify;">In
                                                 this case, people may not meet
                                                 their teachers or classmates. A
                                                 second change is that people
                                                 can interact with others in the
                                                 virtual world. They can post
                                                 their photographs and diaries
                                                 on some social networks such as
                                                 Facebook and Twitter so that
                                                 they can share their lives with
                                                 others. Finally, modern means
                                                 of communication can help
                                                 people broaden their social
                                                 circles. It is easy to make
                                                 friends through the Internet. I
                                                 personally believe that
                                                 progress in technology benefits
                                                 people. Firstly, people can ask
                                                 for help timely when
                                                 encountering troubles. If they
                                                 suffer a car accident, they can
                                                 use their mobile phone to call
                                                 police. In addition, modern
                                                 means of interaction can
                                                 positively contribute to
                                                 understanding between people.
                                                 This is because they can know
                                                 friends better by looking the
                                                 photos or reading the diaries
                                                 that friends post on the
                                                 websites. In conclusion, the
                                                 way people contact each other
                                                 has been change dramatically.
                                                 The new technology offers
                                                 numerals ways of communication
                                                 to people, which positively
                                                 contributes to human
                                                 relationship. I personally
                                                 believe that progress in
                                                 technology benefits people.
                                                 Firstly, people can ask for

                                                 of interactions we have with
                                                 others, disconnecting us from

                                                 leading to an imminent sense of
                                                 isolation in today’s society.
                                                 This is the society we live in,
